            <h3>What is Pokemon?</h3>
            <p>Pokemon, also known as "Pocket Monsters" is a video game series created by GameFreak founder and developer Satoshi Tajiri. Realeased in Japan in 1996 with their first game Pokemon Red and Green, introducing players to a world filled with mysterious creatures that could be caught, trained, and battled. Since then, Pokémon has grown into a global phenomenon, spanning games, trading cards, TV shows, movies, and more! Each Pokémon species has unique abilities, types, and personalities, making them fun to collect, train, and bond with. From capturing your first Pokémon to becoming a Champion, the world of Pokémon offers endless adventure, strategy, and friendship.
